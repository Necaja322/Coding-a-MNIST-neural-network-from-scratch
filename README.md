# Coding-a-MNIST-neural-network-from-scratch
The idea of this mini project was for me to get a hand on feel about how Neural Networks are coded in ML packages and fully understand the algorithms better, the code should be read with a guide explaining the forward and especially backpropagation mechanism. 
The object oriented nature makes adding additional layers straighforward.
Tensorflow is only used to import MNIST, as this has nothing directly to do with ML and is an exercise in data manipulation.
A lot of improvments can be made, early stopping switching to convolutional nns etc.
