# Coding-a-MNIST-neural-network-from-scratch
The idea of this mini project was for me to get a hand on feel about how Neural Networks are coded in ML packages and fully understand the algorithms better, the code should be read with a guide explaining the forward and especially backpropagation mechanism. 
The object oriented nature makes adding additional layers straighforward
A lot of improvments can be made, early stopping switching to convolutional nns etc.
